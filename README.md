# Telco Churn Project

## Objective: 
- Predict what variables are driving customers to churn using the classification methodologies learned.
- Aquire, prepare, explore, test, model and make visualizations of what are the main drivers of churn. 
- Present to the codeup panel of my finding in a jupyter notebook.

## Goal: 
>The goal of this project is try and predict what variables are driving customers to churn using classification methods recently learned. I will be analyzing the telco data set in codeups sql server. The data set contains 72 months of data.

## Data Dictionary:

## Thoughts: 
I want to 

## Initial Hypothesis: 

## Project Planning:
- Create an aquire.py from the codeup SQL database.
- Create an prepare.py. Address missing data, outliers
- Create dummy variables and encode as needed
- Summarize and visualize data
- Split data into train, validate and test

### Model
- Try different algorithms: logistic regression, decesion trees, random forest and KNN. 
- See what features are influencing churn
- Train and adjust parameters in algorithims
- Validate on the top three
- Test on the top model

## Conclusion
- Summarize what is driving churn
- Recommendations?

## How to Reproduce:
- Import acquire.py and prepare.py files on a jupyter notebook
